# Welcome to my blog

Hi there, may name is Argelio Santos and in this blog I will be documenting my journey learning GitHub for saving and sharing code.

Exciting!! As Day 1 starts I hope the blog content continues to grow and one day I can look back to this and see a massive learning trail, and hopefully share it with anyone who is interested in learning from it as well!!
